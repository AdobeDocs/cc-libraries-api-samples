# Quick Start: cURL

This sample shows how to make a call from a simple cURL script that you can run from the command line.

## What it does

This sample makes a `GET` request to `/libraries/`. It will then print the response data in your terminal.

## Setup

### 1. Add access credentials to the script

In the script, replace the `<API_KEY_HERE>` and `<TOKEN_HERE>` placeholders with your API key and bearer token. Do not include the surrounding angle brackets (`< >`) in your final script.

See the [How To Get Your Developer Credentials](https://www.adobe.io/creative-cloud-libraries/docs/integrate/setup/developer-credentials/) tutorial to learn how to get values for these credentials.

### 2. Run the sample

In your terminal, run the sample:

```shell
chmod u+x curl-script.sh # First time only

./curl-script.sh
```
